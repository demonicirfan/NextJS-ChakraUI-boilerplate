## Library folder

What should we add to this library? Anything about the domain that isn't a component, like:

    queries
    mutations
    custom hooks
    contexts
    props functions (getServerSideProps, getInitialProps)

These utilities are typically used within components (for the most part) and partly within the pages for functions such as getServerSideProps.
